# SmartKnock

This project demonstrates a **Door Bell Sensor** system using Arduino and Tinkercad. The system simulates the functionality of LDR and thermistors while incorporating a buzzer, ultrasonic sensor, and LED to create an interactive doorbell solution.

## Project Lead
**Bhakti Harale**

## Learning Objectives
- Simulate the workings of LDR and thermistor.
- Utilize Tinkercad for electronics and Arduino projects.
